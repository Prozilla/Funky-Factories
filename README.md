## Download

1. Go [here](https://github.com/Prozilla/Funky-Factories/blob/main/build/FunkyFactories.jar) to download the executable jar file.
2. If you don't already have a JRE, go to [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and click download on the latest version.
3. Finally, simple open the jar file and the game should launch in a new window (note that this window is currently unable to be resized or changed to fullscreen mode).

If you're using a mac you'll likely get an error message saying "The Java Jar file "FunkyFactories.jar" could not be launched". If this happens, open a terminal using `command` + `space bar` and type `java -jar \path\to\FunkyFactories.jar`.
